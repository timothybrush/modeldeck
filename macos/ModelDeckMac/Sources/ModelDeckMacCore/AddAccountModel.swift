// Issue #8 — the add-account flow's view model (spec "Add account",
// mockups §05). Three steps:
//   1. details  — provider + label + purpose + color; the daemon creates the
//                 isolated owner-only profile home.
//   2. signIn   — the provider's own login command runs in the user's
//                 terminal; browser OAuth is entirely the provider's flow and
//                 ModelDeck never sees or stores credentials.
//   3. confirm  — the daemon reads back the authenticated identity ("Signed
//                 in as …"), pulls the first usage snapshot, and the account
//                 lands in the deck.
// Safety: nothing here (or in the daemon endpoints it calls) ever runs
// `claude auth logout` — the known pitfall in docs/HANDOFF.md.
//
// Issue #560 adds a second shape for Grok, which has neither a profile home
// ModelDeck can create nor a sign-in it can launch (decision 0035). It runs
// in two steps:
//   1. details — the same fields, plus the existing grok CLI home the daemon
//                discovered, read-only, with every refusal shown before the
//                Connect button goes live.
//   2. confirm — the account is saved, one billing reading is taken, and the
//                card that landed is shown. No reading, no connection: the
//                reference rolls back rather than leaving a card that can
//                never fill in.
