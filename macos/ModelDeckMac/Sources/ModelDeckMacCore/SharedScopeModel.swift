// Issue #204 — the UI half of the shared-across-accounts user scope (Tim
// approved direction, 2026-08-01): an opt-in Settings toggle that makes
// user-scope MCP server registrations and user memory one shared set across
// every managed Claude account. The daemon owns the entire mechanism
// (backups, section-level merge, symlinks, reversibility, crash safety);
// this model only asks for the guarded enable/disable op, renders progress,
// and relays the daemon's disclosed merge outcome calmly. Credentials,
// keychain items, and per-account settings are never shared — and never
// touched by anything here.
