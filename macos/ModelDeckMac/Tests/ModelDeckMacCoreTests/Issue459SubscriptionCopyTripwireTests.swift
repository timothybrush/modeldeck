// Issue #459 — TRIPWIRE copy-says-subscriptions.
//
// Tim's ruling: user-facing copy calls a deck member a SUBSCRIPTION, never an
// "account". Pinning a handful of sentences would only protect the sentences
// that happened to exist the day the sweep ran, so this scans every Swift
// source in the app for display literals carrying the word — the check that
// catches the word coming back in a string nobody thought to assert on.
//
// What is deliberately NOT covered: internal identifiers, API paths, JSON
// keys, persisted setting values, and comments — the scope guard on the issue
// keeps those saying "account". Sentences quoting the PROVIDER's own sign-in
// language ("run /login as that account") are listed in `allowedLiterals`
// with their reason; add to that list only with the same kind of reason.

private let allowedLiterals: [String: String] = [
    // Issue #648's amended ruling explicitly names the provider's account
    // switching control and supplies this consent wording.
