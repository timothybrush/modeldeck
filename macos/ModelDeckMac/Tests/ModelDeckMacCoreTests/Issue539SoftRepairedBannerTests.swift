// Issue #539 — the state Tim hit twice, most recently on 2026-08-20.
//
// He repaired a pool credential with the in-app Fix sign-in, the proxy marked
// it active again, and the deck kept a RED banner up saying the last seven
// requests had failed — with an older sign-in session's "The sign-in was not
// finished in time. Start it again…" sitting beside it. He read both as "the
// sign-in didn't take" and went hunting for a different kind of sign-in.
//
// Doctrine 0034 is untouched: only a measured routed success clears the alert.
// What changes is what the surviving alert SAYS while it waits. The daemon
// decides (credential verdict ok, flip newer than the last failure); these
// tests pin the render seam that both the deck and Settings read.
//
// Placeholder identities only — this repo mirrors publicly.
